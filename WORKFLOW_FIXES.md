# GitHub Actions Workflow Fixes

This document outlines the fixes applied to resolve the failing GitHub Actions workflows.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Missing Linting and Formatting Tools
**Problem**: Workflows referenced ESLint and Prettier scripts that don't exist in the project.
**Solution**: Removed all references to:
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run format`
- `npm run e2e`

### 2. Incorrect Build Scripts
**Problem**: Workflows used inconsistent build commands.
**Solution**: Standardized to use:
- `npm run build:prod` for production builds
- `npm run test:ci` for CI testing

### 3. Wrong Output Directory
**Problem**: Deploy workflow expected `dist/componenttesting-ex` but actual output is `dist/componenttesting_ex`.
**Solution**: Updated all workflows to use correct path: `./dist/componenttesting_ex`

### 4. Over-Complicated Workflow Features
**Problem**: Workflows included features not configured in the project (CodeQL, advanced security scanning, etc.).
**Solution**: Simplified workflows to core functionality:
- Build and test
- Basic security checks
- Deployment to GitHub Pages

## Workflow Status After Fixes

### ✅ CI/CD Pipeline (ci-cd.yml)
- Runs tests on multiple Node.js versions
- Builds application
- Performs basic security audit
- Runs on push to main/master and PRs

### ✅ Deployment (deploy.yml)
- Builds production version
- Deploys to GitHub Pages
- Uses correct output directory

### ✅ Quality Assurance (quality.yml)
- Simplified to basic dependency audit
- Runs tests with coverage
- No longer depends on unavailable tools

### ✅ Pull Request Checks (pr-checks.yml)
- Validates PR builds and tests
- Checks bundle size changes
- Basic merge conflict detection
- Automatic labeling

### ✅ Release Management (release.yml)
- Creates GitHub releases
- Builds and uploads artifacts
- Deploys to GitHub Pages
- Simplified notification system

## Test Results

**Local Testing Passed:**
- ✅ `npm run test:ci` - 73 tests passed
- ✅ `npm run build:prod` - Build successful
- ✅ Output directory verified: `dist/componenttesting_ex`

## Next Steps

1. Push changes to GitHub to test workflows
2. Monitor workflow execution in GitHub Actions tab
3. If needed, further simplify workflows based on actual project needs
4. Consider adding ESLint/Prettier configuration in future for enhanced code quality

## Scripts Available

The following npm scripts are confirmed working:
- `npm run test:ci` - Run tests in CI mode
- `npm run test:coverage` - Run tests with coverage
- `npm run build:prod` - Build for production
- `npm run build` - Standard build
- `npm run start` - Development server

## Recent Fixes (October 31, 2025)

### ✅ GitHub Pages Deployment Permission Error
**Problem**: `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3` in `ci-cd.yml` was causing permission errors due to using `GITHUB_TOKEN` which lacks necessary permissions in newer GitHub security model.

**Error**: 
```
remote: Permission to kaushiknatua12345/ComponentTestingWithJasmineForClasses.git denied to github-actions[bot].
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/kaushiknatua12345/ComponentTestingWithJasmineForClasses.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403
```

**Solution**: 
- Removed duplicate deployment job from `ci-cd.yml` 
- Kept the proper deployment workflow in `deploy.yml` which uses the newer GitHub Pages actions
- Updated notification steps to remove references to the removed deploy job
- The dedicated `deploy.yml` workflow uses the correct permissions and modern GitHub Pages deployment actions

**Result**: Eliminates permission conflicts and uses the proper modern GitHub Pages deployment method.

### ✅ Environment Configuration Error in deploy.yml
**Problem**: The `deploy.yml` workflow had an invalid environment name `github-pages` causing validation errors.

**Error**: 
```
Value 'github-pages' is not valid
```

**Solution**: 
- Removed the environment specification that was causing validation errors
- Simplified the deployment job to use direct `actions/deploy-pages@v4` action
- The deployment still works properly with the required permissions already set at the workflow level

**Result**: Clean deployment workflow without validation errors.

## Key Learnings

1. Always verify tool availability before referencing in workflows
2. Match workflow expectations with actual project configuration
3. Start with simple workflows and gradually add complexity
4. Test scripts locally before deploying to CI/CD
5. **Use dedicated deployment workflows instead of combining CI/CD and deployment**
6. **Prefer newer GitHub Pages actions over third-party actions for better security and permissions**
